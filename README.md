# _printf

A formatted output conversion C program completed as part of the low-level programming sprint at ALX Software Engineering program. The program is a pseudo- recreation of the C standard library function, `printf`.

# Dependencies

The `_printf` function was coded on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS machine with `gcc` version 9.3.0

# Usage

To use the `_printf` function, assuming the above dependencies have been installed, compile all `.c` files in the repository and include the header `main.h` with any main function.
Example `main.c`:
```
#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    _printf("Hello, World!");

    return (0);
}
```
